# [Hi, I'm Rittik Basu ðŸ‘‹](https://rittik.io/)

I'm a full-stack engineer specializing in building & designing scalable applications with great user experience. My current tech stack includes Next.js, Typescript & Tailwind and I occasionally dabble in machine learning & blockchain technology. I also blog and tweet about things I'm building, books I'm reading and stuff I find interesting.
