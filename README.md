# [Hi, I'm Rittik Basu 👋](https://rittik.io/)

I'm a full-stack engineer specializing in building & designing scalable applications with great user experience. My current tech stack includes Next.js, Typescript & Tailwind and I occasionally dabble in machine learning & blockchain technology. I also [blog](https://www.rittik.io/blog) and [tweet](https://twitter.com/_rittik) about things I'm building, books I'm reading and stuff I find interesting.
