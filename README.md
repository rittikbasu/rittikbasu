# Hi, I'm Rittik Basu <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px" height="30px" />

I'm a full-stack engineer specializing in building & designing scalable applications with great user experience. My current tech stack includes Next.js, Typescript & Tailwind and I occasionally dabble in machine learning & blockchain technology. I also blog and tweet about things I'm building, books I'm reading and stuff I find interesting.
